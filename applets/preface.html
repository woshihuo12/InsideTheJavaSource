<P>
My primary goal in writing this book was to explain the Java virtual machine,
and several core Java APIs closely related to the virtual machine, to Java
programmers. Although the Java virtual machine incorporates technologies
that had been tried and proven in other programming languages, prior to Java
many of these technologies had not yet entered into common use. As a
consequence, many programmers will be encountering these technologies for the
first time as they begin to program in Java. Garbage collection,
multi-threading, exception handling, dynamic extension--even the use of a
virtual machine itself--may be new to many programmers. The aim of this
book is to help programmers understand how all these things work, and in
the process, to help them become more adept at Java programming.

<P>
Another goal I had in mind as I wrote this book was to experiment a bit
with the changing nature of text. Web pages have three interesting
characteristics that differentiate them from paper-based text: they're
dynamic (they can evolve over time), they're interactive (especially if you
embed Java applets in them), and they're interconnected (you can easily
navigate from one to another). Besides the traditional text and figures,
this book includes several Java applets (in a mini-web site on the CD-ROM)
that serve as "interactive illustrations" of the concepts presented in the
text. In addition, I maintain a web site at <CODE>artima.com</CODE> on the
internet that serves as a launching point for readers to find more (and
more current) information on the topics covered in the book. This book is
composed of all of these components: text, figures, interactive
illustrations, and constantly evolving links to further reading.
